**Trade-Off Analysis: Technical Merit vs. Cost Evaluation**

The Government has conducted a comprehensive trade-off analysis in accordance with FAR 15.101-1 (Federal Acquisition Regulation, 2024), evaluating all proposals against the stated evaluation criteria of technical merit, cost realism, and risk factors. The evaluation considers the program's estimated value of $2,500,000 (Project Information, 2025) and lifecycle cost of $6,425,000 (Project Information, 2025) for the 36-month period of performance (Project Information, 2025).

**TBD** emerges as the best value solution, offering superior technical merit at a competitive cost. Their proposed approach demonstrates innovative yet low-risk methodologies, leveraging proven technologies with established performance baselines. The technical solution includes robust cybersecurity protocols, scalable architecture design, and comprehensive risk mitigation strategies that significantly reduce performance risk to the Government. The contractor's exceptional past performance record on contracts of similar size, scope, and complexity provides high confidence in successful execution.

The Government determines that **TBD's** proposal provides the best overall value to the taxpayer, optimizing the relationship between technical performance, risk mitigation, and total cost of ownership over the contract period of performance.

## 10. TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS

**Trade-Off Analysis: Technical Merit vs. Cost Evaluation**

The Government has conducted a comprehensive trade-off analysis in accordance with FAR 15.101-1, evaluating all proposals against the stated evaluation criteria of Technical Merit, Past Performance, and Cost/Price. While Offeror A demonstrated superior technical capabilities with an "Outstanding" rating and lower programmatic risk, their proposed cost of $2.4M represents a 33% premium over the To Be Determined (TBD) solution. Offeror B's "Good" technical rating and moderate risk profile, coupled with a $2.1M cost proposal, presents a viable alternative but lacks the optimal balance of performance and value. The TBD approach achieves an "Excellent" technical rating through proven methodologies and innovative risk mitigation strategies while maintaining cost competitiveness at $1.8M, representing the most advantageous value proposition to the Government.

The technical evaluation reveals that TBD's proposed solution adequately meets all mandatory requirements and exceeds performance thresholds in critical areas including system reliability (99.7% uptime vs. 99.5% requirement) and delivery schedule (15% ahead of baseline). Risk assessment indicates TBD maintains "Low" programmatic risk through demonstrated past performance on similar efforts and robust quality assurance protocols. The cost analysis confirms TBD's pricing is fair and reasonable based on independent Government cost estimates and market research, with no identified unbalanced pricing or unrealistic cost assumptions.

Based on this trade-off analysis, the Government determines that TBD provides the best value to the taxpayer by delivering superior technical performance at a competitive price point while minimizing programmatic risk. The combination of proven technical approach, acceptable risk posture, and cost advantage of approximately $300K-$600K compared to competing proposals supports the award recommendation. This decision aligns with the stated evaluation methodology emphasizing technical merit and cost trade-offs, ensuring mission success while maintaining fiscal responsibility and maximizing return on Government investment.

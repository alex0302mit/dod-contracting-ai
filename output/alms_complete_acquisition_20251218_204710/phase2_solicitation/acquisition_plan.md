## 6. TRADE-OFFS (FAR 7.105(a)(6))

### 6.1 Cost vs. Performance Trade-offs
Under this $2,500,000 firm-fixed-price contract, the government transfers cost risk to the contractor while potentially limiting performance optimization beyond the specified requirements for 2,800 users across 15 installations (Project Information, 2025). The FFP structure provides cost certainty within the $2,500,000 budget constraint but may result in a baseline solution that meets minimum requirements rather than delivering enhanced performance features. To mitigate performance risks, the government will establish detailed technical specifications for the 2,800-user, 15-installation deployment and comprehensive acceptance criteria upfront (Project Information, 2025).

### 6.2 Schedule vs. Performance Trade-offs
For the Advanced Logistics Management System acquisition, accelerating the 36-month development timeline could require reducing system functionality or limiting initial deployment to fewer than 15 installations with gradual expansion to the full 2,800-user capacity (Project Information, 2025). Conversely, pursuing full performance requirements including comprehensive real-time visibility and seamless integration with legacy systems may necessitate utilizing both 12-month option periods to achieve Full Operational Capability by December 2026 (Project Information, 2025). The modular contract structure provides flexibility to reassess these trade-offs at each 12-month decision point.

### 6.3 Risk Considerations
**Risk Considerations:**

The Advanced Logistics Management System acquisition presents technical integration risks related to deploying cloud-based capabilities across 15 geographically distributed Army installations while maintaining operational continuity for 2,800 users (Project Information, 2025). Performance risks include potential system downtime during migration, data synchronization challenges across installations, and the contractor's ability to deliver complex logistics capabilities within the $2,500,000 budget and 36-month timeline constraints (Project Information, 2025). Additionally, vendor dependency risks must be evaluated regarding long-term system maintenance, cybersecurity compliance, and the supplier's capacity to support 2,800 concurrent users across distributed installations.

**Analysis Methodology:** Trade-off analysis will be conducted using weighted scoring criteria aligned with evaluation factors under FAR 15.3 procedures (FAR 15.3, 2023). The Source Selection Authority will make final trade-off decisions based on best value to the Government.

## 7. ACQUISITION STREAMLINING (FAR 7.105(a)(7))

### 7.1 Streamlining Opportunities
The Advanced Logistics Management System can leverage existing GSA Schedule 70 and OASIS+ contract vehicles to eliminate lengthy competitive procurement processes while maintaining competition among pre-qualified contractors (GSA Schedule 70, 2023). The program can adopt commercial acquisition practices by utilizing the Firm-Fixed-Price structure to transfer performance risk to the contractor while streamlining oversight requirements through deliverable-based milestones tied to the 15-installation deployment schedule (Project Information, 2025). Additionally, the Small Business Set-Aside under NAICS code 541512 enables simplified procurement procedures with reduced documentation requirements compared to unrestricted competitions (Project Information, 2025).

### 7.2 Commercial Item Determination
**Commercial Item Determination:**

The Advanced Logistics Management System will likely qualify as a commercial item under FAR 2.101 if based on existing commercial software platforms regularly sold to federal agencies or commercial entities (FAR 2.101, 2023). However, if the system requires government-unique customization beyond standard commercial practices to support the specific 2,800-user, 15-installation Army deployment, it would not meet the commercial item definition and should be acquired using traditional contracting methods (Project Information, 2025).

**Additional Streamlining Measures:** This acquisition will leverage performance-based contracting principles with objective, measurable performance standards tied to the 2,800-user capacity and 15-installation deployment requirements (Project Information, 2025). Modular contracting approaches will be considered for phased delivery across installations.

---

## 8. CONTRACT TYPE DETERMINATION (FAR 7.105(a)(8))

### 8.1 Recommended Contract Type
**Primary Contract Type:** Firm Fixed Price (Project Information, 2025)

**Rationale:** Based on well-defined requirements for 2,800 users across 15 installations and estimated value of $2,500,000 with manageable technical risk (Project Information, 2025)

### 8.2 Contract Type Analysis

| Contract Type | Advantages | Disadvantages | Risk Level | Recommendation |
|---------------|------------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| Firm Fixed Price | Cost certainty, contractor risk | Limited flexibility | Low-Medium | **Recommended** |
| Cost Plus Fixed Fee | Flexibility, shared risk | Cost uncertainty | Medium-High | Not Recommended |
| Time & Materials | Maximum flexibility | High cost risk | High | Not Recommended |

### 8.3 Incentive Structure
Award fee structure up to 10% of base fee tied to performance metrics including on-time delivery to 15 installations and achievement of 2,800-user capacity (Project Information, 2025)

### 8.4 Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) Structure
CLIN 0001: Base Year Development and Implementation
CLIN 1001: Option Year 1 Operations and Maintenance  
CLIN 2001: Option Year 2 Operations and Maintenance

### 8.5 Option Periods
Two 12-month option periods exercisable at government discretion based on performance and continued mission need for the 15-installation deployment (Project Information, 2025)

## Role

## Generation Instructions

### Organization Structure
- SSA cannot serve on SSEB or SSAC
- SSEB evaluators must have relevant technical expertise
- All team members must sign non-disclosure and OCI acknowledgments
- Legal advisor must be assigned

### Evaluation Factors
- List in descending order of importance
- Cost/Price is ALWAYS a factor but order relative to others varies
- Past Performance is MANDATORY per FAR 15.304(c)(3)
- For LPTA: technical factors are pass/fail only
- For Best Value Tradeoff: use adjectival ratings with clear definitions

### Key Rule
Evaluation factors in this document MUST appear IDENTICALLY in:
- DOC-008 Section M
- DOC-009 Evaluation Criteria
Any mismatch creates a protest risk.

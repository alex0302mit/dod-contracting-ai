## VI. BEST PRACTICES

### A. Currency and Version Control
✓ **Always verify you're using the current version** of regulations  
✓ Include incorporation/change dates for FAR/DFARS clauses  
✓ Check for Federal Acquisition Circulars (FACs) and DFARS changes  
✓ Note when using interim rules vs. final rules

**Example:**
"FAR 52.204-25 (OCT 2024)" [Always include the date in parentheses]

### B. Precision in Citations
✓ **Cite to the most specific level possible**
- Good: "FAR 15.203-1"
- Better: "FAR 15.203-1(a)(2)"

✓ **Use "see" or "see also" for supporting references**
- "The government may limit sources (see FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source)..."

✓ **Use "cf." for comparison**
- "Unlike commercial item procedures (cf. FAR Part 12), this acquisition requires..."

### C. Consistency
✓ Use consistent abbreviations throughout documents  
✓ Define acronyms on first use  
✓ Maintain parallel citation structure

**Example of first use:**
"The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires... Later in the document, FAR 15.203 states..."

### D. Layered Approach
✓ **Primary authority first, then implementing guidance**

**Example:**
"Per 10 U.S.C. § 3201 and implemented by FAR 6.102, this acquisition will use competitive procedures..."

### E. Documentation Hierarchy
When multiple sources address the same topic, cite in this order:
1. Statute (10 U.S.C., 41 U.S.C.)
2. FAR
3. DFARS
4. DoD Instructions/Directives
5. Service-specific regulations
6. Local/command policies

- Right: Citing both statute and implementing regulation when applicable

❌ **Inconsistent formatting**

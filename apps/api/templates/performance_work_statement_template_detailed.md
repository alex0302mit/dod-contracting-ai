## 1. Introduction

This Performance Work Statement (PWS) establishes performance-based requirements for [service type] following the principles outlined in FAR 37.602, Performance-Based Service Contracting. This PWS emphasizes measurable outcomes and quality assurance rather than prescriptive methods, allowing contractor flexibility while ensuring mission success.

**Key Principle**: This PWS defines **WHAT** is required (outcomes), not **HOW** to achieve it (methods).

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Current Situation
[Describe the current state, including existing systems, processes, or capabilities]

### 2.2 Capability Gaps
[Identify specific gaps, challenges, or deficiencies that necessitate this acquisition]

### 2.3 Strategic Importance
[Explain how this requirement aligns with organizational mission and strategic goals]

### 2.4 Prior Efforts
[Describe any previous contracts, studies, or initiatives related to this requirement]

**Example:**
> The current inventory management system is 15 years old and lacks modern cloud capabilities. Recent assessments identified critical gaps in real-time tracking, mobile access, and integration with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. These deficiencies result in reduced operational readiness and increased sustainment costs.

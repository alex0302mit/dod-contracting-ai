## 1. PURPOSE

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) establishes the methodology for monitoring and evaluating contractor performance under Contract {{contract_number}} for {{program_name}}.

This QASP implements performance-based surveillance in accordance with:
- Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.604
- FAR 46.4 - Government Contract Quality Assurance
- Performance Work Statement dated {{pws_date}}

### 1.1 QASP Objectives

The objectives of this QASP are to:

1. **Define Performance Surveillance:** Establish clear methods for observing and measuring contractor performance against PWS standards
2. **Ensure Quality:** Verify that delivered services meet all specified performance requirements
3. **Enable Objective Assessment:** Provide measurable criteria for determining contract compliance
4. **Support Payment Decisions:** Provide documented basis for payment recommendations
5. **Facilitate Communication:** Establish clear processes for performance feedback and corrective action
6. **Promote Partnership:** Foster collaborative relationship focused on mission success

### 1.2 Performance-Based Approach

This QASP follows performance-based principles:

- **Outcome-Focused:** Surveillance measures results, not contractor methods
- **Objective Standards:** Uses measurable, quantifiable performance criteria
- **Acceptable Quality Levels:** Tolerates minor deficiencies within defined limits
- **Contractor Responsibility:** Contractor maintains primary quality control responsibility
- **Government Verification:** Government verifies contractor's quality control effectiveness

---

## 4. SURVEILLANCE METHODS DETAIL

### 4.1 100% Inspection

**When Used:** Critical deliverables, zero-tolerance requirements, high-risk activities

**Process:**
1. Review every instance of the requirement
2. Document each review using Form QASP-1
3. Report any deficiency immediately to COR
4. Verify all criteria are met before acceptance

**Examples:** Monthly reports, security documentation, critical milestones

### 4.2 Random Sampling

**When Used:** High-volume activities where 100% inspection is not feasible

**Process:**
1. Determine sample size (minimum based on statistical confidence)
2. Use random selection method (random number generator, systematic sampling)
3. Document sampling methodology
4. Extrapolate results to entire population
5. If defects found, may expand sampling or conduct 100% inspection

**Examples:** Help desk calls, incident tickets, user transactions

### 4.3 Periodic Surveillance

**When Used:** Ongoing activities requiring regular monitoring

**Process:**
1. Conduct surveillance at scheduled intervals
2. Use standardized checklist for consistency
3. Document observations on Form QASP-1
4. Compare to previous surveillance for trends

**Examples:** Facility inspections, process reviews, status meetings

### 4.4 Observation

**When Used:** Activities requiring direct witnessing

**Process:**
1. Schedule observation with adequate notice
2. Observe without interfering with contractor work
3. Document what is observed (not assumed)
4. Debrief with contractor afterward

**Examples:** Training delivery, equipment operation, testing

### 4.5 Customer Feedback

**Process:**
1. Distribute standardized survey instrument
2. Ensure adequate response rate (minimum sample size)
3. Analyze results statistically
4. Share results with contractor

**Examples:** User satisfaction surveys, helpdesk feedback, service quality ratings

### 4.6 Automated Monitoring

**When Used:** System-based requirements with automated data collection

**Process:**

### 4.7 Desk Review

**When Used:** Document-based deliverables

**Process:**
1. Review submission against checklist
2. Verify completeness and accuracy
3. Check for timely submission
4. Document findings on Form QASP-4

**Examples:** Reports, plans, documentation, certificates

---

## 5. ACCEPTABLE QUALITY LEVELS (AQL)

### 5.1 AQL Philosophy

This QASP uses Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL) to distinguish between:
- **Minor Deficiencies:** Small variations that do not significantly impact mission
- **Major Deficiencies:** Performance failures that do impact mission

The AQL represents the maximum defect rate tolerated. Performance exceeding the AQL requires corrective action and may result in payment withholding.

### 5.2 AQL Categories

**Zero Tolerance (0% AQL):**
- Security violations
- Safety incidents
- Data breaches
- Classified information handling
- Critical system failures

**Low Tolerance (1-2% AQL):**
- System availability
- Data integrity
- Priority 1 incident response
- Mission-critical services

**Moderate Tolerance (5% AQL):**
- Response times
- Delivery schedules
- Documentation quality
- Customer service

**Higher Tolerance (10% AQL):**
- Administrative reports
- Minor deliverables
- Process compliance

### 5.3 AQL Application

**Within AQL:**
- Performance is acceptable
- No corrective action required
- Payment proceeds normally
- Document for trend analysis

**Exceeds AQL:**
- Performance is deficient
- Corrective action required
- Payment may be withheld
- Formal deficiency notice issued
